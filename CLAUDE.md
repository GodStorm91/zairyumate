# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Role & Responsibilities

Your role is to analyze user requirements, delegate tasks to appropriate sub-agents, and ensure cohesive delivery of features that meet specifications and architectural standards.

## Workflows

- Primary workflow: `./.claude/rules/primary-workflow.md`
- Development rules: `./.claude/rules/development-rules.md`
- Orchestration protocols: `./.claude/rules/orchestration-protocol.md`
- Documentation management: `./.claude/rules/documentation-management.md`
- And other workflows: `./.claude/rules/*`

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** You must follow strictly the development rules in `./.claude/rules/development-rules.md` file.
**IMPORTANT:** Before you plan or proceed any implementation, always read the `./README.md` file first to get context.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

## Hook Response Protocol

### Privacy Block Hook (`@@PRIVACY_PROMPT@@`)

When a tool call is blocked by the privacy-block hook, the output contains a JSON marker between `@@PRIVACY_PROMPT_START@@` and `@@PRIVACY_PROMPT_END@@`. **You MUST use the `AskUserQuestion` tool** to get proper user approval.

**Required Flow:**

1. Parse the JSON from the hook output
2. Use `AskUserQuestion` with the question data from the JSON
3. Based on user's selection:
   - **"Yes, approve access"** → Use `bash cat "filepath"` to read the file (bash is auto-approved)
   - **"No, skip this file"** → Continue without accessing the file

**Example AskUserQuestion call:**
```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "I need to read \".env\" which may contain sensitive data. Do you approve?",
    "header": "File Access",
    "options": [
      { "label": "Yes, approve access", "description": "Allow reading .env this time" },
      { "label": "No, skip this file", "description": "Continue without accessing this file" }
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` first. Never try to work around the privacy block without explicit user approval.

## Python Scripts (Skills)

When running Python scripts from `.claude/skills/`, use the venv Python interpreter:
- **Linux/macOS:** `.claude/skills/.venv/bin/python3 scripts/xxx.py`
- **Windows:** `.claude\skills\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\xxx.py`

This ensures packages installed by `install.sh` (google-genai, pypdf, etc.) are available.

**IMPORTANT:** When scripts of skills failed, don't stop, try to fix them directly.

## [IMPORTANT] Consider Modularization
- If a code file exceeds 200 lines of code, consider modularizing it
- Check existing modules before creating new
- Analyze logical separation boundaries (functions, classes, concerns)
- Use kebab-case naming with long descriptive names, it's fine if the file name is long because this ensures file names are self-documenting for LLM tools (Grep, Glob, Search)
- Write descriptive code comments
- After modularization, continue with main task
- When not to modularize: Markdown files, plain text files, bash scripts, configuration files, environment variables files, etc.

## Documentation Management

We keep all important docs in `./docs` folder and keep updating them, structure like below:

```
./docs
├── project-overview-pdr.md
├── code-standards.md
├── codebase-summary.md
├── design-guidelines.md
├── deployment-guide.md
├── system-architecture.md
└── project-roadmap.md
```

**IMPORTANT:** *MUST READ* and *MUST COMPLY* all *INSTRUCTIONS* in project `./CLAUDE.md`, especially *WORKFLOWS* section is *CRITICALLY IMPORTANT*, this rule is *MANDATORY. NON-NEGOTIABLE. NO EXCEPTIONS. MUST REMEMBER AT ALL TIMES!!!*
# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
